These are solutions to The Elements of Computing Systems, which is a very good
book aimed at teaching Computer Science from a very low level (hardware and 
logic) up to high level (virtual machines, assemblers and compilers).

Most of the book is available for free at http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs (in the
"Study Plan" section), though several chapters are missing, and I highly 
recommend purchasing the book.

The solutions are organised by chapter.
